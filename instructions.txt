1) Download and put all the files in the same directory.
2) Make sure you have python and c++ setup in your pc.
3) Then run the following command in your powershell/terminal "g++ main.cpp tsp.cpp -o tsp" (without the double quotes!).
4) Now we will generate the input file for tsp by running the city_genertor.cpp ....
   now run the command "./gen.exe 100 > tsp_input_1.txt" (don't use any other name for input file).
   If everything goes correctly, we would have successfully generated the input data for tsp.
5) Now run the following command to find the optimal path for the generated test set "./tsp tsp_input_1.txt".
6) The above command will find and store the optimal ordering of points in a file by the name of "tsp_output".
7) Now to visualize the optimal path run the following command "python visualizer.py".
